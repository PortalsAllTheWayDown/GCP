When cloud users request a resource or service in GCP, they need to have a project to track resources and quota usage. GCP project are the basis for enabling and using GCP services.
Inside a GCP project users must enable billing to monitor, maintain and address the costs of the GCP services running on the project itself.

Projects are separate compartments and they are isolated from each other. GCP resources belong to exactly one project and they  cannot be shared across projects, except for shared VPC networks, which can be shared with other projects.

GCP projects have three identifying attributes that uniquely distinguish them globally. These are as follows:
-Project ID: This is a permanent, unchangeable identifier that is unique across GCP globally. GCP generates one at project creation but you can choose your unique ID if needed. The project ID is a human readable string that can be used as a seed for uniquely naming other GCP resources, such as Google Cloud Storage bucket names.
-Project Name: This is a nickname that you can assigne to your project for your convenience. It does not need to be unique and it can be changed over time.
-Project number: This is a permanent, unchangeable number that is unique across GCP globally. This number is generated by GCP and it cannot be chosen

Projects can also belong to a GCP organization for business scenarios or they can exist without one.

Project must belong to a billing account.
This billing account is linked to a payment profile.
