Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) is a virtualized private network and data center. Compute resources, storage, and load balancers live within VPC inside the Google Cloud production network that belongs to a specific project. VPC is powered by Andromeda, the GCP network virtualization stack, which is fully distributed to avoid having a single point of failure. A VPC network provides the following:
-Connectivity service for interconnected Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE) clusters, and an App engine flexible environment.
-Connectivity services to private on-premises networks using cloud VPN tunnels or cloud interconnect services.
-Traffic distribution from Google Cloud load balancers and the backends running inside GCP.

GCP projects can have multiple VPC networks that can contain several subnets for each region they cover.

VPC networks logically seperate resources, even though they are in the same project. 
Compute instances that stay in the same network can communicate with each other, even though they are in different regions without using public internet.
Instances in the same regions but different networks cannot communicate with each other unless they pass through the public internet or VPC peering between the different VPC networks.

VPC networks have the following properties:
-Networks are global resources and do not belong to any region or zone. They are contained in one specific project and may span across all the available GCP regions.
-Networks use subnets to logically group GCP resources in one region. Therefore, subnets are regional resources, and they span across zones.
-Networks do not have any IP addresses assigned, while subnets do and they belong to private IPv4 ranges.
-Routes and firewall rules are global resources, and they are associated with one network.
-Firewall rules control the traffic to and from a virtual machine.
-Networks only support IPv4 unitcastt traffic. Multicast, broadcast, or IPv6 traffic within the network are not supported.

Two ways to create a VPC network within a GCP project:
-Auto mode: The network has one subnet for each abailable region and default predefined firewall rules. The IP address range has a fixed /20 for each subnet thats created.
-Custom mode: The network has no default preconfigure subnets and the user has full control over defining all the network resources, such as subnet IP ranges, firewalls, and routing configuration.
