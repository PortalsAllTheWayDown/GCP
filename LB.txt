Google Cloud Load Balancing services are engineered on fully distributed and scalable infrastructure that uses software-defined networking to direct traffic to VPC networks. This helps avoid a single point of failure and allows traffic at scale.

External Google Cloud LBs provide the following features:
- a single external ip address as the frontend
- Global or regional load balancing to reach your application from the internet
- Internal load balancing
- Layer 4 to Layer 7 load balancing
