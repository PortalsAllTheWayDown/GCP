Its important to deploy resources across zones or even regions. This prevents you from having an infrastructure outage that affects all resources simultaneously.
-zonal resource: this is a resource that is specific to a zone such as a virtual machine instance
-regional resource: This is a resource that is specific to a region and spans over multiple zones, such as a static ip address.
-global resource: This is a location independent resource, such as a virtual machine instance image.

When latency is a crucial topic in your application it is very important to choose the zone or region closest to your point of service. For example, if the end users of a servce are located mostly in the west part of Europe, your service should be placed in that region or zone.

you can list all cloud compute regions from your cloud shell:
gcloud compute regions list
gcloud compute zones list
